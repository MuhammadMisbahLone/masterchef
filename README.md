soya chunks
Soya has become one of the most controversial food items these days. Is it rich in healthy omega 3 or it is loaded with harmful estrogen? Various concerns regarding some soy products have surfaced in the recent years, thus bringing back the love for soya chunks! Soya chunks are to a vegetarian what chicken breast is to a non-vegetarian- a great source of protein! However, that is not the only nutrient soya chunks have to offer. A plus point is that they are ridiculously easy to add to your diet.
